### About
This repository contains a record of the projects I built for CS 432, Introduction to Networks. The assignment descriptions for these project expected the projects to be written in Python, and included skeleton code for Python scripts. However, I elected to write the projects in C because:

1. The internet is built on embedded systems whose software is largely written in C.
1. C is a performant, low-level language and felt like a more natural choice for writing low-level websocket code.
1. I wanted to learn more about the nuts and bolts of low-level and system code.
1. I wanted to design my own code from scratch that fulfilled the project requirements.
1. I like C more than I like Python :)

Obviously, if you are a student taking this class now, please do not plagiarize my code. That said, because the code is uniquely mine, and does not rely on any third party libraries authored by professors, I feel comfortable posting it on Github.

### Development
These projects were each developed in about 2 weeks of part time work. The code files have not been edited since they were submitted for review, but the README's have been updated to include more robust descriptions of the project.

The test environment for this project was Debian 11 on WSL.
